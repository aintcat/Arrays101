## In-Place Array Operations Introduction

## Overview
In programming interviews, the interviewer often expects you to minimize the time and space complexity of your implementation. In-place array operations help to reduce space complexity, and so are a class of techniques that pretty much everybody encounters regularly in interviews.

## What Are In-Place Array Operations?
In-place array operations are techniques that modify the array directly without using extra space for another array. These operations are efficient in terms of space complexity, often requiring only a constant amount of extra space, typically O(1).

## Example
The best way of answering this question is to look at an example.

### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers, return an array where every element at an even-indexed position is squared.

**Input**: 
```python
array = [9, -2, -9, 11, 56, -12, -3]
```
