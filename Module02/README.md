# Basic Array Operations

Now that we have a solid understanding of what an array is and how it is stored in the computer's physical memory, the next step is to explore the operations that arrays support. An array is a data structure, meaning it organizes data in a specific format and allows for certain operations on this data.

Consider the DVD inventory management software from the introduction. Here are some operations you might want to perform using this software:

1. Insert a new DVD into the collection at a specific location.
2. Delete a DVD from the collection if it is no longer needed in the inventory.
3. Search for a particular DVD in the collection. This is a frequently performed operation, as the software would be used numerous times daily to find specific DVDs requested by users.

In this section, we will examine the three fundamental operations supported by almost every data structure: insertion, deletion, and search.
